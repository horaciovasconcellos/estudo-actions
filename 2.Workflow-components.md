## Use the components of a workflow 

### Identify the correct syntax for workflow jobs (i.e. indentation and encapsulation of parts of the workflow) 

In GitHub Actions, a workflow is a configurable automated process that you set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub. Workflows are composed of one or more jobs. Jobs are a set of steps that execute on the same runner. 

The syntax for defining a job in a workflow file (which is a YAML file) is as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    name: Job Name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
```

In this example, `jobs` is a key that holds all the jobs that the workflow will run. Each job is represented by a `job_id` (which you can choose), and each job has a `name`, a `runs-on` key to specify the type of runner that the job will run on, and a `steps` key that contains all the steps that the job will execute.

Indentation is crucial in YAML files as it determines the structure of the data. Each level of indentation represents a level of hierarchy. In the example above, `name`, `runs-on`, and `steps` are all indented under `job_id`, indicating that they are properties of the job.

Encapsulation refers to the grouping of related properties and behaviors into individual objects, in this case, jobs. Each job encapsulates its properties (`name`, `runs-on`) and behaviors (`steps`). 

### Use job steps for actions and shell commands 

In a GitHub Actions workflow, a job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner. These steps can be either actions or shell commands. 

An action is a reusable unit of code that can be included in a workflow. Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow and can be created by you, by GitHub, or by a third-party. Actions are represented in workflows with the `uses` keyword followed by the name of the action. For example:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

On the other hand, shell commands are commands that you can run directly in the runner's shell. These are represented with the `run` keyword followed by the command. For example:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Run a one-line script
  run: echo Hello, world!
```

So, the active selection is advising that you should use job steps to define both actions and shell commands in your workflows. This allows you to create complex workflows by combining multiple actions and commands in the same job.

### Use conditional keywords for steps 

In a GitHub Actions workflow, steps are the smallest discrete units of work that make up a job. Each step in a job executes on the same runner, allowing you to compose a job from a series of sequential steps.

Sometimes, you may want a step to only run under certain conditions. This is where conditional keywords come in. The `if` conditional keyword allows you to set conditions for when a step should run. 

Here's an example of how to use the `if` conditional keyword in a step:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Check out repository code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Run a job step only if a condition is met
  run: echo The condition was met!
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

In this example, the second step will only run if the `github.ref` (which holds the branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow) is equal to 'refs/heads/main'. This means that the step will only run if the workflow was triggered by a push to the 'main' branch.

Using conditional keywords in your steps allows you to create more flexible and dynamic workflows.

### Describe how actions, workflows, jobs, steps, runs, and the marketplace work together 

1. **Actions**: Actions are the smallest units of work in GitHub Actions. They are reusable pieces of code that can perform a specific task, such as checking out your repository's code or deploying your application to a server. Actions can be created by you, by GitHub, or by third-party developers.

2. **Steps**: Steps are individual tasks that you can combine to create a job. A step can either run a shell command or use an action. When a step uses an action, it executes the code defined in the action. When a step runs a shell command, it executes the command in the runner's shell.

3. **Jobs**: Jobs are a series of steps that execute on the same runner. By default, a workflow can run multiple jobs in parallel, but you can also configure jobs to depend on each other.

4. **Workflows**: Workflows are automated procedures that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub. Workflows are composed of one or more jobs and can be triggered by various GitHub events (like a push or pull request), scheduled to run at specific times, or run manually.

5. **Runs**: A run is an instance of your workflow that runs when the pre-defined event occurs. Each run contains the jobs defined in the workflow. You can see the logs for each run in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository.

6. **Marketplace**: The GitHub Marketplace is a central location for sharing and discovering actions. It allows developers to distribute and consume actions that have been shared by the GitHub community. You can use an action from the marketplace in your workflow by referencing it in a step.

In summary, actions, workflows, jobs, steps, runs, and the marketplace all work together to provide a flexible platform for continuous integration and continuous deployment. You define workflows composed of jobs, which are themselves composed of steps. These steps can use actions, which can be sourced from the GitHub Marketplace. When the event that triggers your workflow occurs, a run is created, executing your jobs and steps.

### Identify scenarios suited for using GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners 

In GitHub Actions, a runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed. You can use runners to run your workflow jobs. There are two types of runners: GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners.

**GitHub-hosted runners** are virtual machines hosted by GitHub. They are automatically updated, maintained, and managed by GitHub. They are ideal for standard workflows and when you want to avoid the overhead of managing and maintaining your own servers. However, they come with some limitations, such as a maximum job execution time and limited availability of certain hardware and software resources.

Scenarios suited for GitHub-hosted runners include:
- You have a standard build that doesn't require specialized hardware or software.
- You want to avoid the overhead of managing and maintaining your own servers.
- You need to build and test your code across different operating systems (GitHub-hosted runners offer Windows, Linux, and macOS environments).

**Self-hosted runners** are runners that you host on your own servers. They give you more control over the environment and are useful when you need a specific type of hardware or software that GitHub-hosted runners do not provide. However, they require more maintenance as you are responsible for updating and managing them.

Scenarios suited for self-hosted runners include:
- You need a specific type of hardware or software that is not available in GitHub-hosted runners.
- You have a job that requires more than the maximum execution time allowed by GitHub-hosted runners.
- You have a job that requires access to certain network resources that are only available in your local network.

In summary, the choice between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners depends on your specific needs, the resources you have available, and the amount of control and maintenance you want over your runners.

### Implement workflow commands as a run step to communicate with the runner 

In GitHub Actions, a runner is a server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed. Runners listen for available jobs, run the jobs, and report the progress, logs, and results back to GitHub. 

A workflow is composed of jobs, and each job contains a series of steps. These steps can either run a shell command or use an action. When you want to communicate with the runner, you can do so by implementing workflow commands as a run step.

Workflow commands allow you to interact with the runner to set environment variables, output values, create debug messages, and more. These commands are implemented as part of a run step in the form of specific strings you write to the standard output.

Here's an example of how to use a workflow command in a run step:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Set environment variable
  run: echo "NAME=value" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

In this example, the `echo "NAME=value" >> $GITHUB_ENV` command sets an environment variable named `NAME` with the value `value` on the runner. This environment variable will be available to subsequent steps in the job.

By implementing workflow commands as run steps, you can effectively communicate with the runner to control and influence the behavior of your jobs and steps.

### Demonstrate the use of dependent jobs

In GitHub Actions, a workflow is composed of one or more jobs. By default, jobs run in parallel, but you can also configure jobs to run in a specific order by defining dependencies between them. This is done using the `needs` keyword in the workflow file.

Here's an example of how to use dependent jobs:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Say hello
      run: echo "Hello, from job1!"

  job2:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Say hello
      run: echo "Hello, from job2!"
```

In this example, `job2` is dependent on `job1`. This means that `job2` will not start until `job1` has completed successfully. If `job1` fails, `job2` will not run.

Using dependent jobs allows you to create workflows where certain jobs only run if other jobs have completed successfully. This can be useful in scenarios where, for example, you want to deploy your application only if the build and test jobs have passed.
