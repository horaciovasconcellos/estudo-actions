## Work with events that trigger workflows 

### Configure workflows to run for one or more events 

In GitHub Actions, workflows are automated procedures that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub. Workflows are configured using YAML syntax, and each workflow must have at least one job that contains a set of steps.

Workflows are triggered by specific events. These events can be GitHub platform events (like a push or pull request), scheduled events (using cron syntax), or external events (using the repository dispatch webhook).

To configure a workflow to run for one or more events, you use the `on` keyword in your workflow file. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: My Workflow
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

In this example, the workflow is configured to run whenever a `push` event or a `pull_request` event occurs on the repository. This means that the workflow will run whenever code is pushed to the repository or a pull request is created or updated.

By configuring workflows to run for specific events, you can automate your software development practices based on the actions that occur in your repository.

### Configure workflows to run for scheduled events 

In GitHub Actions, workflows can be triggered by various types of events, one of which is a scheduled event. Scheduled events allow you to run a workflow at specific times using POSIX cron syntax.

To configure a workflow to run for scheduled events, you use the `on` keyword followed by `schedule` in your workflow file. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: My Scheduled Workflow
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

In this example, the workflow is configured to run at midnight UTC every day. The `cron` syntax `'0 0 * * *'` specifies when the workflow should run. It follows the format of `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`.

By configuring workflows to run for scheduled events, you can automate tasks that need to happen at specific times, such as nightly builds, daily reports, or regular data processing tasks.

### Configure workflows to run for manual events 

In GitHub Actions, workflows can be triggered by various types of events, including manual events. Manual events allow you to manually trigger a workflow run from GitHub's UI. This is useful when you want to have control over when a workflow should run, rather than having it automatically triggered by code pushes, pull requests, or other GitHub events.

To configure a workflow to run for manual events, you use the `on` keyword followed by `workflow_dispatch` in your workflow file. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: My Manual Workflow
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

In this example, the workflow is configured to run manually. You can trigger the workflow run by navigating to the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository, selecting the workflow, and then clicking on the "Run workflow" button.

By configuring workflows to run for manual events, you can have workflows that run on demand, giving you more control over when certain actions should be performed.

### Configure workflows to run for webhook events (i.e. check_run, check_suite, deployment, etc.) 

In GitHub Actions, workflows can be triggered by various types of events, including webhook events. Webhook events are triggered by specific actions that occur in your GitHub repository, such as when a check run is created, a check suite is completed, or a deployment is created.

To configure a workflow to run for webhook events, you use the `on` keyword followed by the name of the webhook event in your workflow file. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: My Webhook Workflow
on:
  check_run:
    types: [created, completed]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

In this example, the workflow is configured to run whenever a check run is created or completed. The `types` keyword allows you to specify which types of check run events should trigger the workflow.

By configuring workflows to run for webhook events, you can automate tasks based on specific actions that occur in your repository, giving you more control over your software development workflow.

### Demonstrate a GitHub event to trigger a workflow based on a practical use case

GitHub Actions workflows can be triggered by various types of events, including GitHub platform events like a `push` or `pull_request`. These events are triggered by specific actions that occur in your GitHub repository.

A practical use case could be to run a workflow whenever code is pushed to the repository, which could then build and test the code to ensure it's working as expected. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: Build and Test
on: push
jobs:
  build_and_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered by the `push` event. Whenever code is pushed to the repository, the workflow will run. It checks out the code, installs the necessary dependencies, and then runs the tests. This ensures that the code is always in a good state and that any issues are caught early.

By using GitHub events to trigger workflows, you can automate your software development practices based on the actions that occur in your repository.
