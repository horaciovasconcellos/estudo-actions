## Use available action types

### Identify the type of action required for a given problem (i.e. JavaScript, Docker container, run step)

In GitHub Actions, there are three main types of actions you can use in your workflows: JavaScript actions, Docker container actions, and run steps.

- **JavaScript Actions**: These actions run directly on the runner machine and are faster to start up. They are ideal for simpler tasks that don't require specific system dependencies. They can be written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

- **Docker Container Actions**: These actions run inside a Docker container on the runner machine. They are useful when you need a specific environment or when your action has complex dependencies. They can be written in any language that can run in a Docker container.

- **Run Steps**: These are not actions per se, but steps in your workflow where you directly run commands in the runner's shell. They are useful for simple tasks or for running scripts in your repository.

To identify the type of action required for a given problem, you need to consider the requirements of the task. If the task is simple and doesn't require specific system dependencies, a JavaScript action or run step might be sufficient. If the task requires a specific environment or has complex dependencies, a Docker container action might be more appropriate.

By choosing the right type of action for each task, you can create efficient and effective workflows that solve your problems.

### Demonstrate how to troubleshoot JavaScript actions

Troubleshooting JavaScript actions involves identifying and resolving issues that occur when the actions are run. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot JavaScript actions:

1. **Check the Workflow Run Log**: The first step in troubleshooting is to check the log of the workflow run. This can be accessed from the "Actions" tab in your repository. The log will show the output of each step in the workflow, including any error messages from your JavaScript actions.

2. **Use Debug Logging**: GitHub Actions provides debug logging which can be enabled by setting a secret named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` with the value `true` in your repository. This will provide more detailed logs that can help identify issues.

3. **Inspect the Action's Code**: If the issue is not clear from the logs, you may need to inspect the code of the JavaScript action. Look for any potential issues in the code that could be causing the problem.

4. **Test the Action Locally**: You can run the JavaScript action locally to further investigate the issue. You can do this by checking out the repository and running the action's code using Node.js.

5. **Check the Action's Documentation**: The action's documentation may provide information on common issues and how to resolve them. It may also provide information on how to configure the action, which could help resolve your issue.

By following these steps, you can identify and resolve issues with JavaScript actions, ensuring that your workflows run smoothly and effectively.

### Demonstrate how to troubleshoot Docker container actions

Troubleshooting Docker container actions involves identifying and resolving issues that occur when the actions are run. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot Docker container actions:

1. **Check the Workflow Run Log**: The first step in troubleshooting is to check the log of the workflow run. This can be accessed from the "Actions" tab in your repository. The log will show the output of each step in the workflow, including any error messages from your Docker container actions.

2. **Use Debug Logging**: GitHub Actions provides debug logging which can be enabled by setting a secret named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` with the value `true` in your repository. This will provide more detailed logs that can help identify issues.

3. **Inspect the Dockerfile**: If the issue is not clear from the logs, you may need to inspect the Dockerfile used by the action. Look for any potential issues in the Dockerfile that could be causing the problem.

4. **Test the Docker Container Locally**: You can run the Docker container locally to further investigate the issue. You can do this by building the Docker image and running a container from it on your local machine.

5. **Check the Action's Documentation**: The action's documentation may provide information on common issues and how to resolve them. It may also provide information on how to configure the action, which could help resolve your issue.

By following these steps, you can identify and resolve issues with Docker container actions, ensuring that your workflows run smoothly and effectively.
