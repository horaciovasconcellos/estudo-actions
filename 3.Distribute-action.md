## Distribute an action

### Identify how to select an appropriate distribution model for an action (i.e., public, private, marketplace)

When you create a GitHub Action, you need to decide how you want to distribute it. There are three main distribution models you can choose from: public, private, and marketplace.

- **Public**: If you choose to make your action public, it will be available to anyone on GitHub. This is a good choice if you want to share your action with the open-source community and allow anyone to use it in their workflows. To make your action public, you simply need to create it in a public repository.

- **Private**: If you choose to make your action private, it will only be available within your GitHub organization or personal account. This is a good choice if your action is specific to your projects and you don't want others to use it. To make your action private, you create it in a private repository.

- **Marketplace**: If you choose to distribute your action through the GitHub Marketplace, it will be available to anyone on GitHub and will be listed in the marketplace for others to discover. This is a good choice if you want to share your action with a wider audience and make it easy for others to find and use. To distribute your action through the marketplace, you need to publish it there following GitHub's guidelines.

The appropriate distribution model for your action depends on who you want to be able to use it and how you want it to be discovered. By considering these factors, you can select the distribution model that best fits your needs.

### Identify the best practices for distributing custom actions

When distributing custom GitHub Actions, there are several best practices you should follow to ensure that your actions are easy to use, reliable, and secure:

1. **Documentation**: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your action. This should include a description of what the action does, instructions on how to use it, and information on any inputs, outputs, and environment variables it uses.

2. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for your actions. This makes it clear when changes are made and helps users understand the impact of updating to a new version.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your action's code. This includes providing helpful error messages and using non-zero exit codes to indicate failures.

4. **Security**: Review your action's code for any potential security vulnerabilities. This is especially important if your action uses third-party dependencies.

5. **Testing**: Test your action thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. This includes testing it in different workflows and different types of repositories.

6. **Licensing**: Include a license with your action. This tells users the terms under which they can use your action.

7. **Support**: Provide a way for users to get support if they have issues or questions about your action. This could be through GitHub issues, a support email, or a community forum.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your custom actions are high-quality, reliable, and easy for others to use.

### Demonstrate how to create a release strategy for an action (i.e. versioning)

Creating a release strategy for a GitHub Action involves deciding how you will version your action and how you will manage updates and changes. Here's a basic outline of how you might create a release strategy:

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (SemVer) for your action. This involves versioning your action as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. For instance, if you make a backwards-incompatible change, you would increment the MAJOR version. If you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, you would increment the MINOR version. For backwards-compatible bug fixes, you would increment the PATCH version.

2. **Release Branches**: Create a separate branch for each major version of your action. This allows you to easily manage and track changes for each version.

3. **Tags**: Use Git tags to mark each release. The tag should match the version number. This makes it easy for users to reference specific versions of your action in their workflows.

4. **Changelog**: Maintain a changelog that details the changes made in each version. This helps users understand what changes have been made and how they might affect their workflows.

5. **Deprecation Policy**: Have a policy for deprecating old versions. This should include how long a version will be supported after a new major version is released, and how users will be notified of the deprecation.

By following these steps, you can create a robust release strategy that makes it easy to manage and update your action, and clear for users to understand what changes have been made in each version.

### Demonstrate how to publish an action to the GitHub marketplace

Publishing a GitHub Action to the GitHub Marketplace involves several steps:

1. **Prepare Your Action for Release**: Before you can publish your action to the marketplace, you need to ensure it's ready for release. This includes testing your action thoroughly, providing comprehensive documentation, and setting up a release strategy.

2. **Create a Release**: Once your action is ready, you need to create a release. This involves tagging a commit with a version number and creating a release on GitHub. The version number should follow semantic versioning principles.

3. **Publish to the Marketplace**: After creating a release, you can publish your action to the marketplace. To do this, go to the main page of your action's repository, click on the "Marketplace" tab, and then click on "Draft a new release". From there, you can choose the release you want to publish, provide additional details about your action, and then click "Publish release".

4. **Maintain Your Action**: After your action is published, you'll need to maintain it. This includes responding to issues, implementing improvements, and releasing new versions as needed.

By following these steps, you can publish your GitHub Action to the marketplace, making it easy for others to discover and use.
