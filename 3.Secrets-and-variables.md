## Use encrypted secrets and environment variables as part of a workflow 

### Use encrypted secrets to store sensitive information 

In GitHub Actions, you can use secrets to manage sensitive information in your workflows. Secrets are encrypted environment variables that you create in a repository or organization. They are not exposed in logs or available to public forks. They can be used to store sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or certificates.

To use encrypted secrets, you first need to add them to your repository or organization settings. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your GitHub repository or organization settings.
2. Click on the "Secrets" tab.
3. Click on "New repository secret" or "New organization secret".
4. Enter a name for the secret and its corresponding value.
5. Click on "Add secret".

Once the secret is added, you can reference it in your workflow file using the `secrets` context. Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use secret
      run: echo "My secret is ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}"
```

In this example, `MY_SECRET` is an encrypted secret that was added to the repository settings. The `secrets` context allows you to access the value of the secret in your workflow.

By using encrypted secrets, you can securely manage sensitive information in your workflows, keeping your data safe while still being able to use it in your automation tasks.

### Identify the available default environment variables during the construction of the workflow 

In GitHub Actions, there are several default environment variables that are automatically made available to you in all workflows. These environment variables provide information about the workflow run, the job, and the runner itself.

Here are some of the default environment variables:

- `GITHUB_WORKFLOW`: The name of the workflow.
- `GITHUB_RUN_ID`: A unique number for each run within a repository. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run.
- `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`: A unique number for each run of a particular workflow in a repository. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run.
- `GITHUB_ACTION`: The unique identifier (id) of the action.
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS`: Always set to 'true' when GitHub Actions is running the workflow.
- `GITHUB_ACTOR`: The name of the person or app that initiated the workflow.
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`: The owner and repository name.
- `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`: The name of the webhook event that triggered the workflow.
- `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`: The path of the file with the complete webhook event payload.
- `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`: The GitHub workspace directory path. The workspace directory contains a subdirectory with a copy of your repository if your workflow uses the actions/checkout action.

You can use these environment variables in your workflow file to get information about the current workflow run, job, or runner. For example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Print GitHub Actor
      run: echo "This workflow was initiated by ${{ env.GITHUB_ACTOR }}"
```

In this example, the `GITHUB_ACTOR` environment variable is used to print the name of the person or app that initiated the workflow.

By identifying and using the available default environment variables, you can create more dynamic and flexible workflows.

### Identify the location to set custom environment variables in a workflow 

In GitHub Actions, you can define custom environment variables in your workflow file. These environment variables can be used to simplify your workflow configuration and make it more dynamic.

There are several places where you can set custom environment variables:

1. **Workflow level**: You can set environment variables that apply to all jobs in the workflow.

```yaml
env:
  MY_VARIABLE: "My Value"
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Print environment variable
      run: echo "My variable is ${{ env.MY_VARIABLE }}"
```

2. **Job level**: You can set environment variables that only apply to a specific job.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      MY_VARIABLE: "My Value"
    steps:
    - name: Print environment variable
      run: echo "My variable is ${{ env.MY_VARIABLE }}"
```

3. **Step level**: You can set environment variables that only apply to a specific step.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Print environment variable
      env:
        MY_VARIABLE: "My Value"
      run: echo "My variable is ${{ env.MY_VARIABLE }}"
```

In all these examples, `MY_VARIABLE` is a custom environment variable that is set to the string "My Value". The `env` keyword is used to define environment variables.

By identifying the location to set custom environment variables, you can create workflows that are more flexible and easier to manage.

### Identify when to use the GITHUB_TOKEN secret 

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a special type of secret that's automatically created by GitHub in your repository when you enable GitHub Actions. It's used to authenticate in the context of the workflow and has a scope that provides permissions to perform a variety of tasks.

Here are some scenarios when you might use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

1. **Interacting with the GitHub API**: The `GITHUB_TOKEN` can be used to make authenticated API calls. This is useful when your workflow needs to create issues, update PRs, or perform other actions that require GitHub API access.

2. **Pushing to the repository**: If your workflow modifies the code (for example, to update dependencies or commit auto-formatted code) and you want to push the changes back to the repository, you can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

3. **Accessing repository packages**: If your workflow needs to access or publish GitHub Packages, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` can be used for authentication.

Here's an example of how to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in a workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Create issue
      run: |
        curl -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
          -d '{"title":"Automated issue","body":"This is an issue created from a workflow"}' \
          https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues
```

In this example, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to authenticate a `curl` request to the GitHub API that creates an issue in the repository.

By identifying when to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, you can leverage its permissions to perform tasks that interact with your repository or the GitHub API.

### Demonstrate how to use workflow commands to set environment variables

In GitHub Actions, you can use workflow commands to create or update the environment variables for the virtual environment where the workflow is running. Workflow commands are special commands that you can run in your workflow file to interact with the workflow environment.

To set an environment variable using a workflow command, you can use the `echo` command in a `run` step, followed by `::set-env name=VARIABLE_NAME::VARIABLE_VALUE`. Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Set environment variable
      run: echo "MY_VARIABLE=My Value" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    - name: Use environment variable
      run: echo "My variable is ${{ env.MY_VARIABLE }}"
```

In this example, the `echo` command is used to set an environment variable named `MY_VARIABLE` with the value "My Value". The `>> $GITHUB_ENV` part of the command writes the variable to a special file that GitHub Actions uses to set environment variables. The variable is then available to subsequent steps in the job.

By using workflow commands to set environment variables, you can dynamically set and update environment variables based on the results of previous steps or other runtime information.
