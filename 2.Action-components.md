## Describe the components of an action

### Identify the files and directory structure needed to create an action

Creating a GitHub Action requires a specific set of files and a directory structure. Here's a basic outline of what you need:

- **action.yml or action.yaml**: This is the main file for your action. It defines the action's inputs, outputs, and main entry point. It's required for every action.

- **Code files**: These are the files that contain the code for your action. If you're creating a JavaScript action, this would be your `.js` files. If you're creating a Docker container action, this would be your `Dockerfile`.

- **node_modules directory**: If you're creating a JavaScript action and using npm packages, you'll have a `node_modules` directory where those packages are installed.

- **dist directory**: For JavaScript actions, it's a common practice to transpile your code (convert it from ES6 to ES5 for compatibility reasons) and place the transpiled code in a `dist` directory.

- **README.md**: This file provides documentation for your action. It should explain what the action does, how to use it, and any inputs or outputs the action has.

- **LICENSE file**: This file contains the license for your action. Including a license is important because it tells other users the terms under which they can use your action.

Here's an example of what the directory structure might look like for a JavaScript action:

```
my-action/
├── action.yml
├── index.js
├── node_modules/
├── dist/
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

By creating these files and following this directory structure, you can create a GitHub Action that is well-organized and easy for others to use.

### Identify the metadata and syntax needed to create an action

Creating a GitHub Action requires specific metadata and syntax in the `action.yml` or `action.yaml` file. This file is the main descriptor for your action and it's required for every action.

Here's an overview of the metadata and syntax needed:

- **name**: The name of your action. This is a string that describes your action in a human-readable format.

- **description**: A short description of what your action does.

- **inputs**: The inputs your action accepts. Each input has a name, description, and optional default value and required flag.

- **outputs**: The outputs your action produces. Each output has a name and description.

- **runs**: This section specifies how to run your action. It includes the `using` field, which can be set to `node12` for JavaScript actions or `docker` for Docker container actions, and the `main` field, which specifies the main script to run for your action.

Here's an example of the metadata and syntax needed to create an action:

```yaml
name: 'My action'
description: 'A description of my action'
inputs:
  input1:
    description: 'Input 1'
    required: true
    default: 'default value'
outputs:
  output1:
    description: 'Output 1'
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'index.js'
```

By providing this metadata and following this syntax, you can create a GitHub Action that is well-defined and easy for others to use.

### Implement workflow commands within an action to communicate with the runner (Note: this includes exit codes)

In GitHub Actions, an action can communicate with the runner machine by using workflow commands. Workflow commands allow an action to interact with the runner to set environment variables, output values, create debug messages, and more.

One important aspect of this communication is the use of exit codes. When a script or command finishes executing, it returns an exit code to indicate whether it completed successfully or encountered an error. By convention, an exit code of 0 indicates success, while any other value indicates an error.

Here's an example of how you might implement workflow commands within a JavaScript action:

```javascript
const core = require('@actions/core');

try {
  // Run some code...

  // Set an output
  core.setOutput('my_output', 'Output value');

  // Set an environment variable
  core.exportVariable('MY_ENV_VAR', 'Environment variable value');

  // Write a debug message
  core.debug('Debug message');

  // If everything was successful, exit with code 0
  process.exit(0);
} catch (error) {
  // If there was an error, write it to the error log
  core.setFailed(error.message);

  // And exit with a non-zero code
  process.exit(1);
}
```

In this example, the action uses the `@actions/core` module to interact with the runner. It sets an output and an environment variable, writes a debug message, and uses exit codes to indicate whether it completed successfully or encountered an error.

By implementing workflow commands within your actions, you can create more interactive and dynamic workflows.
