## Interpret the effects of a workflow

### Identify the event that triggered a workflow from its effects in a repository, issue, or pull request

In GitHub Actions, workflows are triggered by events. These events can be anything from a push to the repository, a pull request being opened, an issue being created, a release being published, and more.

The effects of a workflow in a repository, issue, or pull request can often give you clues about what event triggered the workflow. For example:

- If you see new commits in the repository that were made by GitHub Actions, the workflow might have been triggered by a push event.
- If you see comments on an issue or pull request that were made by GitHub Actions, the workflow might have been triggered by an issue comment event or a pull request event.
- If you see that a deployment was made, the workflow might have been triggered by a release event.

To definitively identify the event that triggered a workflow, you can look at the workflow run in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository. Each workflow run lists the event that triggered it.

By understanding the event that triggered a workflow, you can better understand why the workflow ran and what it did, which can be helpful for debugging and maintaining your workflows.

### Describe a workflow’s effects from reading its configuration file

A GitHub Actions workflow's configuration file, typically named `main.yml` or similar and located in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository, defines what actions the workflow will take when it is triggered. By reading this file, you can understand what effects the workflow will have.

Here's an example of a simple workflow configuration file:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

In this example, the workflow is named "CI" and is triggered on every `push` and `pull_request` event. It has one job named `build` that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

The job has four steps:

1. It checks out your repository using the `actions/checkout@v2` action.
2. It sets up Node.js version 14 using the `actions/setup-node@v2` action.
3. It installs the npm dependencies with `npm ci`.
4. It runs the tests with `npm test`.

So, by reading this configuration file, you can understand that this workflow will test your code with Node.js version 14 on the latest version of Ubuntu every time you push to your repository or open a pull request.

By understanding a workflow's configuration file, you can predict its effects and ensure it is correctly set up to achieve your desired outcomes.

### Diagnose a failed workflow run (i.e. using a workflow run history and its logs, determine why a workflow run may have failed)

When a workflow run fails in GitHub Actions, it's important to diagnose the issue to understand what went wrong. The workflow run history and its logs are key resources for this.

Here's how you can diagnose a failed workflow run:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. Click on the workflow run that failed. This will bring you to a page with more details about the run.
4. On this page, you can see a list of jobs that were part of the workflow run. Click on the job that failed.
5. You will now see a detailed log of the job. This log includes the output of each step in the job, as well as any error messages.

By reading through the log, you can often identify the step where the job failed and the error message that caused the failure. This information can help you understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

For example, the job might have failed because a script returned an error, because a required file was not found, or because a service that the job depends on was not available. The error message will usually give you a clue about the nature of the problem.

By diagnosing failed workflow runs, you can ensure that your workflows are working correctly and fix any issues that arise.

### Identify ways to access the workflow logs from the user interface

Workflow logs in GitHub Actions provide detailed information about each run of a workflow. They include the output of each step in each job of the workflow, as well as any error messages. These logs can be invaluable for debugging and understanding your workflows.

Here's how you can access the workflow logs from the GitHub user interface:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab. This will bring you to a page listing all workflow runs for your repository.
3. Click on the workflow run you're interested in. This will bring you to a page with more details about the run.
4. On this page, you can see a list of jobs that were part of the workflow run. Click on the job you're interested in.
5. You will now see a detailed log of the job. This log includes the output of each step in the job, as well as any error messages.

By accessing the workflow logs, you can gain a deep understanding of what happens during a workflow run, which can help you diagnose issues, optimize your workflows, and ensure they are working as expected.

### Identify ways to access the workflow logs from GitHub’s REST API

GitHub's REST API provides a way to programmatically access the logs of your workflow runs. This can be useful if you want to analyze the logs in a custom way, integrate them with other tools, or store them for long-term archiving.

Here's how you can access the workflow logs from the GitHub REST API:

1. First, you need to get the ID of the workflow run you're interested in. You can do this with the "List workflow runs for a repository" API endpoint:

```http
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs
```

This will return a list of workflow runs for the repository. Each run has an `id` field that you can use in the next step.

2. Once you have the ID of the workflow run, you can get the log for that run with the "Download workflow run logs" API endpoint:

```http
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/logs
```

Replace `{owner}` with the username of the repository owner, `{repo}` with the name of the repository, and `{run_id}` with the ID of the workflow run.

This will return a URL that you can use to download the log file for the workflow run. The log file is in the format of a ZIP archive containing one log file for each job in the workflow run.

By accessing the workflow logs through the GitHub REST API, you can programmatically analyze and process the logs, giving you more flexibility than the GitHub user interface.

### Enable step debug logging in a workflow

Debug logging provides more detailed information about each step in a workflow run, which can be helpful for diagnosing issues and understanding exactly what is happening during the run.

To enable step debug logging in a GitHub Actions workflow, you need to set a secret in your repository named `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` with the value `true`.

Here's how you can do this:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. Click on the "Secrets" section on the left side.
4. Click on the "New repository secret" button.
5. Enter `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` as the name and `true` as the value.
6. Click on the "Add secret" button.

Once you've done this, debug logging will be enabled for all workflow runs in your repository. The logs will include additional information about each step, such as the exact commands that are being run and the values of variables.

Please note that enabling debug logging can expose more information in your logs, including potentially sensitive information. Therefore, you should only enable it temporarily for debugging purposes and disable it once you're done.

By enabling step debug logging, you can gain a deeper understanding of your workflows and more effectively diagnose issues.

### Demonstrate how to use default environment variables in a workflow

GitHub Actions provides a set of default environment variables that you can use in your workflows. These variables contain information about the workflow run and the environment it's running in.

Here's an example of how to use default environment variables in a workflow:

```yaml
name: Print environment variables

on: [push]

jobs:
  print-vars:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Print variables
      run: |
        echo "GitHub Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
        echo "GitHub Run ID: ${{ github.run_id }}"
        echo "GitHub SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
        echo "GitHub Ref: ${{ github.ref }}"
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on every `push` event. It has one job named `print-vars` that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

The job has one step that prints the values of several default environment variables:

- `${{ github.repository }}` is the name of the repository where the workflow is running.
- `${{ github.run_id }}` is the unique identifier for the workflow run.
- `${{ github.sha }}` is the SHA of the commit that triggered the workflow.
- `${{ github.ref }}` is the Git ref (branch or tag) that triggered the workflow.

By using default environment variables, you can access important information about the workflow run and the environment it's running in, which can be useful for customizing your workflows and for debugging.

### Demonstrate the correct syntax for passing custom environment variables in a workflow step

In GitHub Actions, you can define custom environment variables for a specific step in your workflow. These variables can then be used in the commands that the step runs.

Here's an example of how to pass custom environment variables in a workflow step:

```yaml
name: Use custom environment variables

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Print custom variables
      run: |
        echo "Custom Variable 1: $CUSTOM_VAR_1"
        echo "Custom Variable 2: $CUSTOM_VAR_2"
      env:
        CUSTOM_VAR_1: This is the first custom variable
        CUSTOM_VAR_2: This is the second custom variable
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on every `push` event. It has one job named `build` that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

The job has one step that prints the values of two custom environment variables: `CUSTOM_VAR_1` and `CUSTOM_VAR_2`. These variables are defined in the `env` section of the step.

By passing custom environment variables in a workflow step, you can customize the behavior of your workflows and make them more flexible and reusable.
