## Manage runners for the enterprise

### Describe the effects of configuring IP allow lists on GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners

Configuring IP allow lists can have significant effects on both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners in terms of security and access control.

**GitHub-hosted runners**: GitHub-hosted runners are virtual machines hosted by GitHub that run your workflows. When you configure an IP allow list for these runners, you're essentially limiting which IP addresses can interact with your runners. This means that only traffic from the allowed IP addresses will be able to reach your runners, adding an extra layer of security. However, it's important to note that GitHub does not currently support IP allow lists for GitHub-hosted runners due to the dynamic IP addresses they use.

**Self-hosted runners**: Self-hosted runners are runners that you host yourself on your own hardware. Configuring an IP allow list for self-hosted runners can be more straightforward because you have control over the runner's IP address. By configuring an IP allow list, you can restrict which IP addresses can interact with your runner, helping to protect it from unauthorized access.

In both cases, configuring IP allow lists can help enhance the security of your runners by giving you control over who can interact with them. However, it's also important to manage and update your allow lists regularly to ensure they remain effective and don't inadvertently block legitimate traffic.

### Describe how to select appropriate runners to support workloads (i.e. using a self-hosted versus GitHub-hosted runner, choosing supported operating systems)

Selecting the appropriate runners for your workloads involves considering several factors:

1. **Self-hosted vs GitHub-hosted Runners**: GitHub-hosted runners are virtual machines that GitHub provides for running your workflows. They are easy to set up and maintain, and they come with a lot of pre-installed software. However, they have some limitations, such as a maximum job execution time and limited storage. On the other hand, self-hosted runners are machines that you provide. They can be more powerful and flexible than GitHub-hosted runners, but they require more setup and maintenance. You might choose self-hosted runners if you need to run jobs that take a long time, require a lot of storage, or need specific hardware or software that GitHub-hosted runners don't provide.

2. **Supported Operating Systems**: GitHub-hosted runners support Windows, Linux, and macOS. You should choose a runner with an operating system that supports the software you're using in your workflows. For self-hosted runners, you can use any machine that can run the GitHub Actions runner application, which includes most modern versions of Windows, Linux, and macOS.

3. **Workload Requirements**: Consider the requirements of your workloads. For example, if your workflows involve building a Windows application, you'll need a runner that supports Windows. If your workflows require a lot of CPU or memory, you'll need a runner that can provide these resources.

By considering these factors, you can select the appropriate runners to support your workloads.

### Explain the difference between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners

GitHub Actions uses runners to execute your workflows. There are two types of runners: GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners.

**GitHub-hosted runners** are virtual machines that are maintained and hosted by GitHub. When you use a GitHub-hosted runner, GitHub takes care of the maintenance, updates, and capacity of the runner. These runners come with a set of pre-installed software for most of the popular languages and frameworks. However, they have some limitations, such as a maximum job execution time and limited storage. Also, you don't have control over the underlying hardware or operating system.

**Self-hosted runners** are machines that you manage and host yourself. These can be your own computers, servers, or virtual machines. When you use a self-hosted runner, you have full control over the hardware, operating system, installed software, and maintenance schedule. This gives you more flexibility and can be useful if you have specific requirements that can't be met by GitHub-hosted runners. However, using self-hosted runners also means you're responsible for their setup, maintenance, and security.

In summary, the choice between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners depends on your specific needs, resources, and the level of control you want over the runner's environment.

### Configure self-hosted runners for enterprise use (i.e. including proxies, labels, networking)

Configuring self-hosted runners for enterprise use involves setting up your own machines to run your GitHub Actions workflows. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Proxies**: If your enterprise network uses a proxy, you'll need to configure your self-hosted runners to use this proxy. This involves setting environment variables for the runner application to use when making network requests.

2. **Labels**: Labels allow you to organize and select your runners. For example, you might have different runners for different types of jobs, and you can use labels to specify which runner to use for each job. When you set up a self-hosted runner, you can assign it one or more labels.

3. **Networking**: You'll need to ensure that your self-hosted runners have the necessary network access. This includes access to the GitHub API, access to any resources your workflows need, and any necessary firewall configurations.

4. **Security**: Since self-hosted runners can execute any code from your workflows, you should ensure they are secured. This includes keeping the runner's machine up-to-date, using security best practices for the runner's machine, and only using self-hosted runners for trusted workflows.

By configuring these aspects, you can effectively use self-hosted runners in an enterprise context, giving you more control and flexibility over your GitHub Actions workflows.

### Demonstrate how to manage self-hosted runners using groups (i.e. managing access, moving runners into and between groups)

Managing self-hosted runners using groups involves organizing your runners into groups and controlling access to these groups. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Creating Runner Groups**: You can create runner groups in your organization's settings under Actions > Runner groups. When creating a group, you can specify which repositories can use the runners in the group.

2. **Adding Runners to Groups**: When you set up a self-hosted runner, you can add it to a group by selecting the group during the setup process. You can also move a runner to a different group by going to the runner's settings and changing the selected group.

3. **Managing Access**: You can manage which repositories can use a runner group in the group's settings. You can choose to allow all repositories, select repositories, or no repositories to use the group. This allows you to control access to your runners and ensure that they are used appropriately.

4. **Moving Runners Between Groups**: If you need to move a runner from one group to another, you can do this in the runner's settings. Simply select the new group from the dropdown menu.

By managing your self-hosted runners using groups, you can better organize your runners and control their usage. This can be particularly useful in larger organizations with many runners and repositories.

### Demonstrate how to monitor, troubleshoot, and update self-hosted runners

Monitoring, troubleshooting, and updating self-hosted runners are important aspects of maintaining a reliable and secure GitHub Actions environment. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Monitoring**: You can monitor the status of your self-hosted runners from the GitHub interface. In your repository or organization settings, you can see a list of your runners and their status (active, idle, offline). Additionally, you can set up external monitoring tools to keep track of the runner's machine health metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, etc.

2. **Troubleshooting**: If a runner is not working as expected, you can check the logs for the runner. These logs are located on the runner's machine in the `_diag` directory of the runner's application directory. The logs can provide detailed information about the runner's operations and any errors that have occurred.

3. **Updating**: To update a self-hosted runner, you'll need to replace the runner application with the latest version. This involves stopping the runner, downloading the latest version of the runner application, and replacing the old application with the new one. After this, you can restart the runner.

By regularly monitoring your runners, promptly troubleshooting any issues, and keeping your runners up-to-date, you can ensure that your GitHub Actions workflows run smoothly and securely.
