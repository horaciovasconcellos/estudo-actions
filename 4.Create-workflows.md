## Create a workflow for a particular purpose 

### Add a script to a workflow 

In GitHub Actions, you can add scripts directly to your workflow file to perform tasks as part of your jobs. These scripts can be written in shell script syntax (for Linux/macOS runners) or PowerShell/Command Prompt syntax (for Windows runners).

To add a script to a workflow, you can use the `run` keyword in a step. The `run` keyword allows you to run any command-line programs, including scripts, directly in the workflow file. Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run script
      run: |
        echo "This is a script."
        echo "It can have multiple lines."
```

In this example, a script is added to the workflow using the `run` keyword. The script is a simple shell script that prints two lines of text. The `|` character allows you to write a multi-line script.

By adding scripts to your workflows, you can perform complex tasks without needing to create separate script files. However, for longer scripts or scripts that you want to reuse across multiple workflows, it might be better to create a separate script file and run that file in your workflow.

### Demonstrate how to publish to GitHub Packages using a workflow 

GitHub Packages is a package hosting service, fully integrated with GitHub. It allows you to host your packages and code in one place. You can publish packages in workflows for many different package management systems, including npm (Node.js), NuGet (.NET), Maven (Java), and more.

Here's an example of how to publish an npm package to GitHub Packages using a workflow:

```yaml
name: Node.js Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
        registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

    - name: Publish
      run: npm publish
      env:
        NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered when a new release is created. It sets up a Node.js environment, installs the package dependencies, builds the package, and then publishes it to GitHub Packages. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is used to authenticate with GitHub Packages.

This is a basic example and your actual workflow might need to be adjusted based on your project's specific needs. For example, you might need to add steps to test your code before publishing, or to configure the package version based on the release tag.

By using workflows to publish to GitHub Packages, you can automate the process of building, testing, and publishing your packages, ensuring that your package repository is always up to date with your latest code.

### Demonstrate how to publish to GitHub Container Registry using a workflow 

GitHub Container Registry is a service from GitHub that allows you to host Docker images within your GitHub account or organization. It's fully integrated with GitHub Packages and provides better support for Docker image hosting.

Here's an example of how to publish a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry using a workflow:

```yaml
name: Publish Docker image

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  push_to_registry:
    name: Push Docker image to GitHub Container Registry
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Log in to the Container registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v1 
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on a push to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, logs into the GitHub Container Registry using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for authentication, and then builds and pushes the Docker image to the registry.

The `docker/login-action@v1` and `docker/build-push-action@v2` are pre-built actions provided by Docker that handle the login and build/push steps, respectively.

### Use database and service containers in a GitHub Actions workflow 

In GitHub Actions, you can use service containers to host services that your application or tests need to interact with. These services can include databases, caches, or any other services that can run in a Docker container.

Service containers are defined in the `services` field of a job. Each service is a Docker container that is networked with the runner container, allowing your steps to interact with the service.

Here's an example of how to use a PostgreSQL database service container in a workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:10.8
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
          POSTGRES_DB: test_db
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        options: --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        # Run tests here
        # The PostgreSQL service is available at localhost:5432
```

In this example, a PostgreSQL service container is created with the `postgres:10.8` image. The `env` field is used to set environment variables in the service container, which are used to configure the PostgreSQL server. The `ports` field maps port 5432 in the service container to port 5432 in the runner container, allowing your steps to connect to the PostgreSQL server at `localhost:5432`.

The `options` field is used to configure a health check command for the service container. This command is used to check that the PostgreSQL server is ready to accept connections before the steps in the job are run.

By using service containers in your workflows, you can create a more realistic testing environment that closely matches your production environment.

### Use labels to route workflows to specific runners 

In GitHub Actions, you can use runners to execute your workflows. Runners are servers that have the GitHub Actions runner application installed. You can use runners hosted by GitHub, or you can host your own.

Each runner has a set of labels, which are used to route workflows to runners that meet the requirements of the workflow. For example, a workflow that needs to run on a Windows machine can be routed to a runner with the `windows` label.

To route a workflow to a specific runner, you can use the `runs-on` keyword in your workflow file, followed by the label of the runner. Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

In this example, the workflow is routed to a runner with the `ubuntu-latest` label, which is a runner hosted by GitHub that runs the latest stable version of Ubuntu.

If you're using self-hosted runners, you can add your own labels to your runners and use those labels to route workflows to specific runners. For example, if you have a runner with a `gpu` label, you can route workflows that need a GPU to that runner:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: gpu
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

By using labels to route workflows to specific runners, you can ensure that your workflows are run on machines that have the capabilities they need.

### Use CodeQL as a step in a workflow 

CodeQL is a tool from GitHub that allows you to perform semantic code analysis. It treats code as data, allowing you to write queries to find code patterns, including potential security vulnerabilities.

To use CodeQL as a step in a workflow, you can use the `github/codeql-action/analyze@v1` action. This action runs the CodeQL analysis on your code and uploads the results to GitHub. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
      with:
        languages: "javascript,python"

    - name: Build
      run: make build

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v1
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on a push or pull request to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, initializes CodeQL with the languages to analyze (JavaScript and Python in this case), builds the code, and then runs the CodeQL analysis.

The results of the CodeQL analysis are available in the "Security" tab of your repository on GitHub.

By using CodeQL in your workflows, you can automatically analyze your code for potential security vulnerabilities every time you push code or open a pull request.

### Demonstrate how to publish a component as a GitHub release using GitHub Actions 

GitHub Actions can be used to automate the process of creating a GitHub release and uploading a component (like a compiled binary, a package, or any other artifact) to that release.

Here's an example of how to create a release and upload an artifact to it using a workflow:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build
      run: make build

    - name: Create Release
      id: create_release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        draft: false
        prerelease: false

    - name: Upload Release Asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ./path/to/your/artifact
        asset_name: artifact
        asset_content_type: application/octet-stream
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered when a new tag is pushed that starts with 'v'. It checks out the code, builds the project, creates a new release, and then uploads an artifact to the release.

The `actions/create-release@v1` action is used to create the release. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is used to authenticate with GitHub.

The `actions/upload-release-asset@v1` action is used to upload the artifact to the release. The `upload_url` output from the `create_release` step is used to specify where to upload the artifact.

By using workflows to create releases and upload artifacts, you can automate the process of releasing new versions of your project.

### Deploy a release to a cloud provider using a GitHub Actions workflow

GitHub Actions can be used to automate the process of deploying a release to a cloud provider. The specific steps to do this will depend on the cloud provider and the type of application you're deploying.

Here's an example of how to deploy a Node.js application to Azure App Service using a workflow:

```yaml
name: Node.js Deploy to Azure

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

    - name: 'Deploy to Azure'
      uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
      with:
        app-name: 'your-app-name'
        slot-name: 'production'
        publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
        package: .
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on a push to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, sets up a Node.js environment, installs the dependencies, builds the application, and then deploys the application to Azure App Service.

The `azure/webapps-deploy@v2` action is used to deploy the application. The `app-name` and `slot-name` inputs specify the Azure App Service app and deployment slot to deploy to. The `publish-profile` input is set to a secret that contains the Azure publish profile, which is used to authenticate with Azure. The `package` input specifies the directory to deploy, which is the current directory ([``.``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fwsl2%2Fgithub%2Fcertifications%2Fgithub-actions%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/wsl2/github/certifications/github-actions")) in this case.

By using workflows to deploy releases to a cloud provider, you can automate the process of deploying your application, ensuring that your application is always running the latest code.
