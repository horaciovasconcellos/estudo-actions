## Manage workflow runs

### Configure caching of workflow dependencies

In GitHub Actions, you can cache dependencies to speed up your workflows. Dependencies that don't change often, like third-party libraries or build artifacts, can be cached so they don't have to be downloaded or built every time the workflow runs.

To configure caching, you can use the `actions/cache@v2` action. This action allows you to specify a path to cache and a key to identify the cache.

Here's an example of how to cache Node.js dependencies:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Cache Node.js modules
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm ci
```

In this example, the `~/.npm` directory is cached. This directory contains the Node.js modules downloaded by npm. The key for the cache is based on the runner's operating system and a hash of the `package-lock.json` files in the repository. If the `package-lock.json` files change, a new cache will be created.

The `restore-keys` input is used to specify a list of keys to use when restoring from cache. If the key doesn't match a cache, the action will search for a cache that starts with the keys listed in `restore-keys`.

By configuring caching for your workflows, you can significantly speed up your workflow runs, especially for workflows that have large dependencies or that need to build large artifacts.

### Identify steps to pass data between jobs in a workflow

In GitHub Actions, each job in a workflow runs independently on its own virtual environment. Therefore, passing data directly between jobs is not possible. However, there are ways to share data between jobs.

One common method is to use artifacts. Artifacts are files that are produced by a job, and can be downloaded and used by other jobs in the same workflow. Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build
      run: make build

    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: my-artifact
        path: ./path/to/artifact

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Download artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: my-artifact
        path: ./path/to/artifact

    - name: Test
      run: make test
```

In this example, the `build` job builds the project and then uploads an artifact. The `test` job, which depends on the `build` job, downloads the artifact and then runs tests.

Another method is to use environment variables or output parameters, but these are limited to sharing small amounts of data.

By using artifacts, you can pass data between jobs in a workflow, allowing you to split your workflow into multiple independent jobs that each perform a specific task.

### Remove workflow artifacts from GitHub

Workflow artifacts are files that are produced by a job and uploaded using the `actions/upload-artifact` action. These artifacts can be downloaded and used by other jobs in the same workflow, or they can be downloaded manually from the GitHub website.

By default, GitHub automatically removes workflow artifacts 90 days after they are created. However, if you want to remove artifacts sooner, you can do so manually from the GitHub website.

Here are the steps to manually remove workflow artifacts from GitHub:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. Click on the workflow run that produced the artifact you want to remove.
4. In the "Artifacts" section, click on the "..." (more options) button next to the artifact you want to remove.
5. Click "Delete".

Please note that once an artifact is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

By managing your workflow artifacts, you can ensure that your GitHub repository doesn't become cluttered with old or unnecessary files.

### Add a workflow status badge

A workflow status badge is a small image that displays the status of a GitHub Actions workflow. It can be added to your repository's README or any other Markdown file to provide a visual indication of whether the workflow is currently passing or failing.

Here's how you can add a workflow status badge:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. Select the workflow you want a status badge for.
4. Click on the "..." (more options) button in the top right corner of the workflow page.
5. Click "Create status badge".
6. Copy the Markdown code that is provided.
7. Paste the copied Markdown code into your README or other Markdown file.

The Markdown code will look something like this:

```markdown
![workflow name](https://github.com/username/repository/actions/workflows/workflow-file.yml/badge.svg)
```

This Markdown code creates an image that links to the workflow run history. The image displays the status of the workflow: "passing" if the last run was successful, "failing" if it was not.

By adding a workflow status badge to your repository, you can provide a quick way for visitors to see the status of your project's workflows.

### Add environment protections

Adding environment protections can help to ensure that certain workflows only run when specific conditions are met. This can be particularly useful for sensitive environments like production. Here's how you can add environment protections:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. Click on "Environments" in the left sidebar.
4. Click on "New environment" and give it a name (e.g., "Production").
5. Once the environment is created, click on "Edit protection rules".
6. Here, you can add the following protections:

   - **Required reviewers**: You can require that specific people or teams review workflow runs that reference this environment. The workflow run will be paused until the required reviewers approve the run.
   
   - **Wait timer**: You can require a certain amount of time to pass before a workflow run that references this environment can be deployed.
   
   - **Environment secrets**: You can add secrets that are only available to this environment. These secrets are stored encrypted and can be used in your workflows like other secrets, but they are only available when the workflow is running in this environment.

Here's an example of how to reference an environment in a workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: 
      name: Production
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: echo "Deploying to Production"
```

In this example, the `deploy` job references the "Production" environment. If there are any protection rules set for this environment, they will be enforced when this job runs.

### Define a matrix of different job configurations

In GitHub Actions, a matrix allows you to create multiple jobs by defining a set of different configurations. This is particularly useful when you want to test your code across different environments, operating systems, or versions of a language or library.

Here's an example of how to define a matrix for a job that tests a Node.js application across multiple versions of Node.js and on both Ubuntu and Windows:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12, 14, 16]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
```

In this example, the `matrix` object under the `strategy` key defines two arrays: `node-version` and `os`. The `test` job will run for each combination of these values, resulting in six jobs in total: one for each version of Node.js on each operating system.

The `matrix` values can be used in the job's `runs-on` key and in the `with` input of the `actions/setup-node` action to specify the operating system and Node.js version for each job.

By defining a matrix of job configurations, you can easily test your code across a variety of environments and configurations, ensuring that it works correctly in all of them.

### Implement workflow approval gates

Workflow approval gates are a feature of GitHub Actions that allow you to pause a workflow at certain points and wait for manual approval before proceeding. This can be useful in situations where you want to manually review or control the deployment of code, for example.

Here's an example of how to implement an approval gate in a workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build
      run: make build

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    environment: 
      name: production
      url: https://prod.example.com
    steps:
    - name: Deploy
      run: make deploy
```

In this example, the `deploy` job has an `environment` key. This tells GitHub to create an environment for this job, and any changes to the environment will require approval. When the `deploy` job runs, the workflow will pause and a reviewer will need to manually approve the job before it can proceed.

The `url` under the `environment` key is optional and can be used to provide a link to the deployed application.

By implementing workflow approval gates, you can add an extra layer of control and security to your workflows, ensuring that changes are reviewed and approved before they are deployed.
