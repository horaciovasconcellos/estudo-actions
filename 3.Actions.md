## Use actions in a workflow

### Define the indicators of what makes a trustworthy action

GitHub Actions are reusable pieces of code that can perform tasks within a workflow. However, not all actions are created equal. Some are more reliable and secure than others. Here are some indicators of what makes a trustworthy action:

1. **Source**: Actions created by GitHub or by reputable organizations are generally more trustworthy. Be cautious with actions from unknown sources.

2. **Usage**: Actions that are widely used by the community are often more reliable, as they have been tested in a variety of scenarios.

3. **Documentation**: Good actions have clear, comprehensive documentation that explains what the action does, how to use it, and what parameters it accepts.

4. **Updates and Maintenance**: Trustworthy actions are regularly updated and maintained. Frequent updates indicate that the action is actively being improved and that any issues are likely to be quickly addressed.

5. **Security**: Actions that follow good security practices are more trustworthy. This includes things like not requesting unnecessary permissions and not exposing sensitive data.

6. **Reviews and Feedback**: Look at the reviews and feedback from other users. If an action has positive reviews and feedback, it's likely to be trustworthy.

By considering these indicators, you can make an informed decision about which actions to use in your workflows, ensuring that your workflows are reliable, secure, and effective.

### Identify an action’s type, inputs, and outputs

The active selection is a directive stating "Identify an action’s type, inputs, and outputs". This is in the context of GitHub Actions.

In GitHub Actions, an action is a reusable unit of code that performs a specific task. Each action has a type, inputs, and outputs:

- **Type**: The type of an action refers to whether it's a JavaScript action or a Docker container action. JavaScript actions run directly on the runner machine and are faster to start up, while Docker container actions run in a Docker container on the runner machine and can use any software that can be packaged in a Docker container.

- **Inputs**: Inputs are parameters that you can pass to an action to customize its behavior. They are defined in the action's `action.yml` or `action.yaml` file under the `inputs` section. Each input has a name, description, and optional default value and required flag.

- **Outputs**: Outputs are values that an action can produce for later steps in the workflow to use. They are defined in the action's `action.yml` or `action.yaml` file under the `outputs` section. Each output has a name and description.

Here's an example of how to identify an action's type, inputs, and outputs:

```yaml
name: 'Hello World'
description: 'Greet someone and record the time'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:  # id of input
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
outputs:
  time: # id of output
    description: 'The time we greeted you'
runs:
  using: 'docker' # type of action
  image: 'Dockerfile'
```

In this example, the action is a Docker container action, as indicated by the `using: 'docker'` line. It has one input named `who-to-greet`, which is required and has a default value of 'World'. It has one output named `time`.

By identifying an action's type, inputs, and outputs, you can understand how to use the action in your workflows and how to customize its behavior.

### Demonstrate how to use the specific version of an action in a workflow

In GitHub Actions, you can specify the version of an action you want to use in your workflow. This is important because different versions of an action may have different behaviors, and using a specific version ensures that your workflow behaves consistently.

Here's how you can use a specific version of an action in a workflow:

```yaml
name: Use specific version of an action

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Use version 2 of the checkout action

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1 # Use version 1 of the setup-node action
      with:
        node-version: '14'
```

In this example, the workflow is using version 2 of the `actions/checkout` action and version 1 of the `actions/setup-node` action. The version is specified after the `@` symbol in the `uses` line.

By using specific versions of actions, you can ensure that your workflows are stable and predictable, even when new versions of the actions are released.
