## Distribute actions and workflows to the enterprise

### Explain reuse templates for actions and workflows

In GitHub Actions, you can create reusable pieces of workflows called "actions", and you can also create templates for entire workflows. These features allow you to maintain consistency across multiple workflows, reduce duplication, and save time when setting up new workflows.

**Action Reuse**: Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions in a repository and reuse them across multiple workflows within the same repository. You can also publish actions to the GitHub Marketplace to share them with the GitHub community, or use actions that others have published.

**Workflow Templates**: Workflow templates are pre-configured workflows that you can use as a starting point for new workflows. You can create your own workflow templates in a repository, and they will be available to all other repositories within the same organization. Workflow templates can include one or more jobs, each with a series of steps that use actions.

To use a workflow template, you would navigate to the "Actions" tab of your repository, click on "New workflow", and then select one of the available templates. You can then customize the workflow to suit your needs.

By reusing actions and using workflow templates, you can streamline your workflow setup process and ensure consistency across your projects.

### Define an approach for managing and leveraging reusable components (i.e. repos for storage, naming conventions for files/folders, and plans for ongoing maintenance)

Managing and leveraging reusable components effectively can greatly enhance the efficiency of your development process. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Repos for Storage**: Use repositories to store and organize your reusable components. Each component could be stored in its own repository, or you could have a single repository for all your components, depending on the size and complexity of the components. Using repositories allows you to leverage version control for your components, making it easier to manage changes and updates.

2. **Naming Conventions**: Establish clear and consistent naming conventions for your files and folders. This makes it easier to understand what each component does and how they are organized. The naming convention should ideally reflect the functionality of the components.

3. **Documentation**: Document each component thoroughly. This should include what the component does, how to use it, any dependencies it has, and any other important information. Good documentation makes it easier for others to use and contribute to your components.

4. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Plan for the ongoing maintenance of your components. This includes regular updates to keep the components current, responding to issues and pull requests, and regularly reviewing the components to ensure they are still relevant and effective.

By following this approach, you can create a robust system for managing and leveraging reusable components, making your development process more efficient and effective.

### Define how to distribute actions for an enterprise

Distributing GitHub Actions for an enterprise involves making your actions available to all the repositories within your enterprise account. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Create Actions in a Central Repository**: Create a central repository (or repositories) within your enterprise account to store your actions. This repository should be accessible to all the other repositories within your enterprise account.

2. **Use Organization Secrets**: If your actions require secrets, use organization secrets rather than repository secrets. Organization secrets are available to all repositories within your enterprise account, making it easier to manage and update secrets for your actions.

3. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for each action. This should include a description of what the action does, instructions on how to use it, and information on any inputs, outputs, and environment variables it uses. Good documentation makes it easier for others within your enterprise to use your actions.

4. **Versioning and Release Strategy**: Use semantic versioning for your actions and have a clear release strategy. This makes it easier to manage updates to your actions and helps users understand the impact of updating to a new version.

5. **Support and Maintenance**: Provide support for your actions and plan for their ongoing maintenance. This includes responding to issues, implementing improvements, and releasing new versions as needed.

By following this approach, you can effectively distribute actions within your enterprise, making it easier for all your teams to leverage these actions in their workflows.

### Define how to control access to actions within the enterprise

Controlling access to actions within an enterprise involves managing who can use, modify, and manage your GitHub Actions. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Repository Permissions**: Control who can use and modify your actions by managing the permissions of the repository where your actions are stored. For example, you might give write access to team members who are responsible for maintaining the actions, and read access to everyone else who needs to use the actions.

2. **Action Permissions**: GitHub also allows you to control the permissions of each action. You can specify which permissions the action has when it runs, limiting its access to resources.

3. **Branch Protection Rules**: Use branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized modifications to your actions. For example, you can require pull requests for changes to your main branch, require approval for these pull requests, and require status checks to pass before changes can be merged.

4. **Secrets Management**: If your actions use secrets, manage who has access to these secrets. Use organization secrets for secrets that need to be available to all repositories, and repository secrets for secrets that are specific to a single repository.

5. **Audit Logs**: Monitor the use of your actions using GitHub's audit logs. This allows you to see who is using your actions and how they are being used.

By following this approach, you can effectively control access to your actions within your enterprise, ensuring that they are used appropriately and securely.

### Configure organizational use policies for GitHub Actions

Configuring organizational use policies for GitHub Actions involves setting up rules and guidelines on how GitHub Actions should be used within your organization. Here's a basic approach:

1. **Usage Guidelines**: Define clear guidelines on how GitHub Actions should be used within your organization. This could include rules on what actions can be used (e.g., only actions from verified creators), how workflows should be structured, and how often workflows should run.

2. **Permissions and Access**: Set up permissions for who can create, modify, and execute actions. This could be based on user roles within your organization.

3. **Security Policies**: Establish security policies for your actions. This could include rules on how secrets are managed, what permissions actions should have, and how code for actions should be reviewed for security vulnerabilities.

4. **Maintenance and Support**: Define responsibilities for maintaining and supporting your actions. This includes updating actions, responding to issues, and providing support to users within your organization.

5. **Audit and Compliance**: Set up processes for auditing the use of actions and ensuring compliance with your policies. This could involve regularly reviewing audit logs, checking for policy violations, and taking corrective action when necessary.

By configuring these policies, you can ensure that GitHub Actions are used effectively and securely within your organization.
