## Manage encrypted secrets in the enterprise

### Identify the scope of encrypted secrets

In GitHub Actions, encrypted secrets are environment variables that are encrypted and can be used in your workflows. The scope of these secrets determines where they can be used and who can access them.

There are three scopes for encrypted secrets:

1. **Repository Secrets**: These secrets are defined in a specific repository and can only be used in workflows running in that repository. They are accessible to collaborators with write access to the repository.

2. **Organization Secrets**: These secrets are defined at the organization level and can be used in any repository within the organization. They are accessible to organization owners and can be made available to selected repositories or all repositories in the organization.

3. **Environment Secrets**: These secrets are defined for a specific environment in a repository. They can only be used in jobs that reference the environment and provide an additional layer of security by restricting access to secrets to specific environments.

By understanding the scope of encrypted secrets, you can manage who has access to sensitive information and where it can be used, helping to keep your workflows secure.

### Demonstrate how to access encrypted secrets within actions and workflows

In GitHub Actions, encrypted secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as API keys, access tokens, and credentials. These secrets are encrypted and can be accessed within your workflows.

Here's how you can access encrypted secrets within actions and workflows:

1. **Defining Secrets**: First, you need to define your secrets. You can do this in the settings of your repository or organization. Go to the "Secrets" section and click on "New repository secret" or "New organization secret". Enter the name of the secret and its value, then click "Add secret".

2. **Accessing Secrets in Workflows**: Once you've defined your secrets, you can access them in your workflows. Secrets are made available to your workflows as environment variables. You can access a secret using the `secrets` context, like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: My step
    env:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
    run: echo "The secret is $MY_SECRET"
```

In this example, `MY_SECRET` is the name of the secret you defined. The `secrets` context allows you to access the value of the secret, and the `env` keyword allows you to set it as an environment variable for the step. The `run` command then uses this environment variable.

Remember, for security reasons, the actual values of secrets are not printed in logs or exposed to untrusted users or processes.

### Explain how to manage organization-level encrypted secrets

Organization-level encrypted secrets are sensitive data that you can store at the organization level in GitHub. They can be made available to selected repositories or all repositories within the organization. Here's how you can manage them:

1. **Creating Organization Secrets**: To create an organization secret, go to your organization's settings, then click on "Secrets". Click on "New organization secret", enter the name of the secret and its value, then click "Add secret".

2. **Setting Access for Organization Secrets**: When you create an organization secret, you can choose which repositories have access to the secret. You can allow all repositories, no repositories, or select specific repositories.

3. **Updating and Deleting Organization Secrets**: You can update the value of an organization secret or delete it from the same "Secrets" settings page. Click on the name of the secret, then click "Update" or "Delete".

4. **Accessing Organization Secrets in Workflows**: Organization secrets can be accessed in workflows in the same way as repository secrets. They are available as environment variables using the `secrets` context, like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: My step
    env:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
    run: echo "The secret is $MY_SECRET"
```

In this example, `MY_SECRET` is the name of the organization secret.

By managing organization-level encrypted secrets, you can securely share sensitive data across multiple repositories in your organization.

### Explain how to manage repository-level encrypted secrets

Repository-level encrypted secrets are sensitive data that you can store at the repository level in GitHub. They are only available to workflows running in the same repository. Here's how you can manage them:

1. **Creating Repository Secrets**: To create a repository secret, go to your repository's settings, then click on "Secrets". Click on "New repository secret", enter the name of the secret and its value, then click "Add secret".

2. **Updating and Deleting Repository Secrets**: You can update the value of a repository secret or delete it from the same "Secrets" settings page. Click on the name of the secret, then click "Update" or "Delete".

3. **Accessing Repository Secrets in Workflows**: Repository secrets can be accessed in workflows as environment variables using the `secrets` context, like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: My step
    env:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
    run: echo "The secret is $MY_SECRET"
```

In this example, `MY_SECRET` is the name of the repository secret.

By managing repository-level encrypted secrets, you can securely store sensitive data that is specific to a single repository.
