## Locate a workflow, its logs, and artifacts

### Describe where to locate a workflow in a repository

In a GitHub repository, workflows are defined in YAML files located in the `.github/workflows` directory at the root level of the repository. Each workflow is defined in its own file, with a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension.

Here's how you can locate a workflow in a repository:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Code" tab if you're not already there.
3. Look for a directory named `.github` and click on it.
4. Inside the `.github` directory, click on the `workflows` directory.
5. Inside the `workflows` directory, you will see one or more YAML files. Each of these files defines a workflow.

By convention, the name of the file is used as the name of the workflow, but the workflow can also have a name defined inside the file with the `name` keyword.

By locating the workflow files in your repository, you can view, edit, and understand the workflows that automate your software development processes.

### Explain the difference between disabling and deleting of workflows

Disabling and deleting workflows are two different actions you can take on a workflow in a GitHub repository, and they have different effects:

- **Disabling a workflow**: When you disable a workflow, it remains in your repository but it does not run in response to events like pushes, pull requests, etc. This is useful if you want to temporarily stop a workflow from running without removing it entirely. You can disable a workflow from the "Actions" tab in your repository by clicking on the ellipsis (...) next to the workflow and selecting "Disable workflow". If you want to run the workflow again in the future, you can re-enable it from the same menu.

- **Deleting a workflow**: When you delete a workflow, you are removing the workflow file from your repository. This means the workflow will no longer exist and cannot be run. To delete a workflow, you need to delete the corresponding workflow file from the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. This is a more permanent action and should be done when you are sure you no longer need the workflow. If you want to restore a deleted workflow, you would need to recreate the workflow file or restore it from a previous commit.

In summary, disabling a workflow is a temporary action that stops the workflow from running but leaves it in your repository, while deleting a workflow is a permanent action that removes the workflow from your repository.

### Demonstrate how to download workflow artifacts from the user interface

Workflow artifacts are files that are produced by a workflow run. They can be anything from compiled binaries and test results to log files and screenshots. Once an artifact is created, it can be downloaded for further analysis or deployment.

Here's how you can download workflow artifacts from the GitHub user interface:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab. This will bring you to a page listing all workflow runs for your repository.
3. Click on the workflow run you're interested in. This will bring you to a page with more details about the run.
4. On this page, scroll down to the "Artifacts" section. Here you will see a list of all artifacts that were produced by the workflow run.
5. Click on the name of the artifact you want to download. This will download the artifact as a ZIP file.

By downloading workflow artifacts, you can examine the output of your workflows in detail, which can help you diagnose issues, understand the behavior of your workflows, and deploy your software.

### Describe how to use an organizationâ€™s templated workflow

A templated workflow is a predefined workflow that an organization provides for its repositories to use. This can help ensure consistency across multiple repositories, as they can all use the same workflow with the same settings.

Here's how you can use an organization's templated workflow:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository within the organization.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. If the organization has provided templated workflows, you will see a list of them under the "Workflows created by your organization" section.
4. Click on the "Set up this workflow" button next to the templated workflow you want to use.
5. This will create a new workflow file in your repository based on the template. You can modify this file as needed to fit your specific needs.
6. Commit the new workflow file to your repository.

Once you've done this, the workflow will be set up in your repository and will run according to the triggers defined in the workflow file.

By using an organization's templated workflow, you can quickly set up workflows that follow the organization's best practices and standards, saving you time and ensuring consistency across repositories.
